			<h2>Airport Experiences</h2>
			<p class="text_format1">So last year I worked at the <em>YOW Ottawa International Airport</em>, and over the time I was there, there were <strong>LOTS</strong> of amusing stories that I came to experience and I figured I would share some of those with you guys.</p>

			<div class="behind_text_box">
				<h3>Story 1: Launguage Barriers</h3>
					
				<p class="text_format2">In international Airports, you are always going to find people from all over the globe speaking all sorts of different languages and dialects. Traveling in different countries where you don't speak the same language as the locals can be difficult due to language barriers. However, in the technological world we live in today, there are all sorts of technological tools and apps that people can use to help with these things and they can be great... when they work properly.</p>	

				<p class="text_format2">One evening at the <em>YOW Ottawa International Airport</em> I was walking with a colleague of mine when a young woman approached us to ask for some assistance. She spoke no English and we could not tell what language she was speaking, so she opened up a language translation app on her phone that she spoke into to ask her question. After a moment the phone translated her question into English and read it aloud <em>"Where I go to retreive luggage?".</em></p>

				<p class="text_format2">My colleague, a very pleasant father of four who has worked at the airport for years and is known for being very friendly, helpful and approachable, was happy to help this young woman. She held out her phone for him to him to speak into the mic as she had, so he said with a smile <em>"Baggage claim is on the 1st floor, I can show you if you'd like?"</em></p>

				<p class="text_format2">The app took a few seconds to translate what he had said and then read the translation aloud to her. Immediately the woman's expression went from neutral to entirely out right appalled within seconds and she slapped my colleague right in the face and then stormed off. </p>

				<p class="text_format2">To this day, we don't know what language the your woman spoke, or what the app had translated my colleagues word into that had caused such a reaction. What we do know however, is that on that day, technology had failed them. Both of them.</p>

				<h3>Story 2: The 80lb Duffle Bag</h3>

				<p class="text_format2"> I was working at the front counter one day when a young gentleman came up and was asking how much it would cost for him to check his duffel bag. Even though the bag was small enough to fit as carry-on, he asked to check the bank anyway, so I told him the regular baggage checking fee and asked him to place the bag onto the baggage belt next to me as I continued his sign in process. These baggage belts all have built in scales that will weigh a person's luggage before it is taken away down the belt. I did not think to ask the weight of this bag at first because it was so small that I didn't believe the weight would be anything worth noting. I was wrong.  </p>

				<p class="text_format2">I watched as this young man struggled to lift the bag onto the baggage belt as if he we’re trying to lift fours hammer. At this point I naturally chose to glance at the Weight scale and was shocked to see the value of 72 pounds staring back at me. At this point I apologized to the gentleman because the baggage checking fee that I had previously told him was that of a piece of luggage under 50 pounds. A cargo that is more than that 50 pounds does have an additional overweight charge to check the item. </p>

				<p class="text_format2">Being the helpful person that I am however, I informed the young man that the overweight charge is actually significantly higher than the price to check the second piece of luggage, so I suggested that he divide the banks contents into two and check two pieces of the Lovett luggage that are in the regular wait Rich range. The man agreed that this would be good decision or him to make and then proceeded to open the duffel bag. </p>

				<p class="text_format2">I try not to look at peoples luggage when they choose to do this, however I couldn’t help but be curious as to what manage to make up 72 pounds in such a small back duffel bag. The answer was……….. frozen peas. A duffel bag filled entirely to the rim of frozen peas. </p>

				<p class="text_format2">I felt the need to comment on this, so I smiled and said “you must really love frozen peas”. It was clear that English was not this man’s first language and I will never forget his response. The man looked at me with the biggest smile as if I had just said something that he had been waiting his entire life to hear and enthusiastically responded by saying “Beautiful yes! I love peeing. Peeing the best everywhere!”. I couldn’t help but smile. It was quite clear what this man was trying to say, but what was actually said was instead quite humorous. </p>
