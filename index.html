			<h2>Airport Experiences</h2>
			<p class="text_format1">So last year I worked at the <em>YOW Ottawa International Airport</em>, and over the time I was there, there were <strong>LOTS</strong> of amusing stories that I came to experience and I figured I would share some of those with you guys.</p>

			<div class="behind_text_box">
				<h3>Story 1: Launguage Barriers</h3>
					
				<p class="text_format2">In international Airports, you are always going to find people from all over the globe speaking all sorts of different languages and dialects. Traveling in different countries where you don't speak the same language as the locals can be difficult due to language barriers. However, in the technological world we live in today, there are all sorts of technological tools and apps that people can use to help with these things and they can be great... when they work properly.</p>	

				<p class="text_format2">One evening at the <em>YOW Ottawa International Airport</em> I was walking with a colleague of mine when a young woman approached us to ask for some assistance. She spoke no English and we could not tell what language she was speaking, so she opened up a language translation app on her phone that she spoke into to ask her question. After a moment the phone translated her question into English and read it aloud <em>"Where I go to retreive luggage?".</em></p>

				<p class="text_format2">My colleague, a very pleasant father of four who has worked at the airport for years and is known for being very friendly, helpful and approachable, was happy to help this young woman. She held out her phone for him to him to speak into the mic as she had, so he said with a smile <em>"Baggage claim is on the 1st floor, I can show you if you'd like?"</em></p>

				<p class="text_format2">The app took a few seconds to translate what he had said and then read the translation aloud to her. Immediately the woman's expression went from neutral to entirely out right appalled within seconds and she slapped my colleague right in the face and then stormed off. </p>

				<p class="text_format2">To this day, we don't know what language the your woman spoke, or what the app had translated my colleagues word into that had caused such a reaction. What we do know however, is that on that day, technology had failed them. Both of them.</p>

				<h3>Story 2: Anger Management - COMING SOON!</h3>
